# Introduction
My motivation to attend this course comes from my curiosity to experience more branches of biology. I was fascinated with the Computer course from last semester and although I didn't understand everything, I encourage myself to dive deeper into learning more about coding. More than anything I am interested in the applications of computation in biology and its potential in genetics and ecology. Behavioral ecology and genomics have always fascinated me and I hope that by bringing the computational aspect I might learn a new side of it. I expect from the course to learn more about scripts in order to be able to write my own without doubting the process too much and makink less mistakes.
