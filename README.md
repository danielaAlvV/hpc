# Introduction
My motivation to attend this course comes from my curiosity to experience more branches of biology. I was fascinated with the Computer course from last semester and although I didn't understand everything, I encourage myself to dive deeper into learning more about coding. More than anything I am interested in the applications of computation in biology and its potential in genetics and ecology. Behavioral ecology and genomics have always fascinated me and I hope that by bringing the computational aspect I might learn a new side of it. From the course, I expect to learn more about scripts and managing data, in order to be able to write my own without doubting the process too much and making less mistakes. 

# Course content
## Github
Github is a version control tool used for collaborative work. Here, we encounter concepts like a repository, which can be viewed as a folder, or commit, which allows us to create versions of our work, and many others that allow us to share our work within collegues. The main idea is to maintain a main branch and many side branches. The side branches can be changed and edited by many users, this allows the development of a project to be independent of the users working on it on the same time. At the end, the host, i.e. the owner of the main branch, can allow some of the changes made by the team on the side branches to be part of the main branch.
